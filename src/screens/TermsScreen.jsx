You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Naamee is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Naamee in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Naamee, and Naamee will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.\n10. It is Naamee's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Naamee does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Naamee is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.`

Naamee's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Naamee reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.
